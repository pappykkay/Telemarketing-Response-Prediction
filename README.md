The primary aim of this study is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of telemarketing response predictions using heterogeneous ensemble techniques. The research focuses on the application of feature selection and the implementation of heterogeneous ensemble methods, specifically stacking, voting, and blending for telemarketing response prediction.
Accurately predicting customer responses to marketing campaigns presents a big challenge to marketing managers because traditional methods have limitations in handling complex, imbalanced, and diverse datasets, which are characteristic of real-world marketing data.
Feature selection preprocessing steps were applied to identify the most relevant predictor variables from the dataset leading to a reduction in the feature space to only informative and relevant features. This process also reduces the impact of irrelevant or redundant variables on the predictive models.
Through ensemble techniques, the predictive power of individual base learners is collectively combined to enhance performance. Stacking involves the combination of predictions from various models using a meta-learner, while voting combines predictions through majority voting. Blending optimally combines model predictions using a weighted approach.
The study was implemented using a layered approach to feature selection, applying class balancing, training, testing, and evaluating the predictive performance through comprehensive experiments on selected real-world telemarketing datasets. The stacking and blending ensemble recorded impressive performance gains yielding 98% accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of feature selection the ensemble techniques in improving the predictive accuracy of the models. The insights gained from this study have the potential to inform data-driven marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and optimise marketing campaign outcomes.
